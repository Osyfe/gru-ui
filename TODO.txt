layout:

1. child -> parent: min, pref & max size + fixed aspect ratio
2. parent -> child: definitive size

improve:

too verbose -> good defaults + builder pattern
layout weird -> two layout passes with clearly defined behaviour
response impl suboptimal -> find better solution, maybe ui events?
dynamic ui slapped ontop -> bake dynamic ui building deep into the system

keep:

modularity
general borrowing + lensing mechanics
