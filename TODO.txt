layout:

1. child -> parent: min size
2. parent -> child: allocated size
3. child -> parent: render size

improve:

too verbose -> good defaults + builder pattern
layout weird -> two layout passes with clearly defined behaviour
response impl suboptimal -> find better solution, maybe ui events?
dynamic ui slapped ontop -> bake dynamic ui building into the system
multiple root widgets awkward -> one master widget and combination widgets

keep:

modularity
general borrowing + lensing mechanics

     #####

fix/add:

x udpate derive to 2021 edition
- systematic "does not fit" checking
- widgets: empty, split, watch, folder, style
