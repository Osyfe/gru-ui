layout:

1. child -> parent: min size
2. parent -> child: allocated size
3. child -> parent: render size

improve:

too verbose -> good defaults + builder pattern
layout weird -> two layout passes with clearly defined behaviour
response impl suboptimal -> find better solution, maybe ui events?
dynamic ui slapped ontop -> bake dynamic ui building into the system
multiple root widgets awkward -> one master widget and combination widgets

keep:

modularity
general borrowing + lensing mechanics

     #####

fix/add:

x udpate derive to 2021 edition
? systematic "does not fit" checking
- response/event/inter widget communication overhaul
     - respond method replacement
     - reponse in response -> ?
- general bool toggle wrapper widget
- enhance lenses from lensing to general data transformers + flexible lifetimes
- bifurcation transform -> multiple children widgets attached
- enum solution
- maybe -> all features deactivatable individually
- widget method blocker wrapper (no update etc.)
- scissoring + scroll widget (counterpart to align)
- popups/-outs (general layers?)
- layout reactions (e.g. longer label popup on hover / shorter label when not enough space)
- textures
- style options
- widgets: split, folder
